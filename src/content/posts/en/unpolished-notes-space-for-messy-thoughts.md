I have a growing collection of notes sitting between _messy_ thoughts and polished blog posts. I'd label them **"TODO > Blog posts"** on Todoist, which means I intend to create blog posts from these notes someday.

That's the problem. The term "blog post" feels heavy. It comes with planning _(where does it fit in my content strategy? when do I schedule it?)_. It comes with the process _(creating a content brief, defining purpose, identifying target audiences — and sooo on)_. It comes with the proper structure _(that intro-body-conclusion format)_. It's mentally and physically consuming. And you know what? Those notes just sit there, rarely turning into blog posts as labeled.

_"But you could publish the notes on social media," one_ voice argues in my head. And that's another problem. I never feel comfortable publishing those unpolished notes on social media, where it's now considered _a calculated space_ for personal branding and lead generation. Publishing unrelated-to-professional-expertise notes seems misaligned. They say, _"Stick to a few content pillars rather than randomly posting."_ But often, my thoughts don't follow those neat categories. They wander, they explore, they branch out randomly.

What I’m doing now is keeping those notes locked in my personal note-taking app, **Capacities** — visible only to me. Here comes another problem _(again?)_. I set to learn in public, to share my journey openly. What’s the point of writing if I am the only one who will ever read it?

What I’m looking for is a public space that’s not crowded like social media platforms, yet more open than my private note-taking app. Think of it as learning in the ‘suburbs’ — quieter than the city center but not as isolated as my own backyard.

So I'm creating a new space: **Unpublished Notes**. A living collection of ideas in progress. This is where I will freely share my random thoughts, what I have learned, or things I'm currently experimenting with. (Of course, I don't call it a blog because that would bring back all those pressures of creating blog posts.)

I use the minimal, beautiful Astro theme by [BlockLune](https://blocklune.cc/) that creates a simple ‘text feed’ — perfect for what I want. I don’t have the ‘rhythm’ of posting here; probably share whenever I feel like to. My goal is to plant seeds in a digital garden, letting ideas breathe and grow naturally.
